Academic Paper Recommendation Chat Application PRD

Project Overview:
A chat application that combines local Gemma and cloud-based Gemini models with RAG capabilities for academic paper queries. The system uses FAISS for local paper retrieval and aims to provide high-quality, non-repetitive paper recommendations.

Current Issues:
1. Response Quality Issues:
   - Repetitive paper listings in responses
   - Inconsistent numbering format
   - Poor deduplication of similar content
   - Incorrect similarity thresholds
   - Paper content truncation and repetition

2. Technical Challenges:
   - Content similarity detection needs improvement
   - Response formatting lacks consistency
   - Paper matching accuracy needs enhancement
   - Content cleaning and normalization requires standardization

Required Features and Improvements:

1. Enhanced Content Deduplication System
   - Implement robust hash-based deduplication
   - Add semantic similarity comparison
   - Set appropriate similarity thresholds
   - Handle edge cases for near-duplicate content

2. Improved Paper Matching Algorithm
   - Implement two-phase search strategy
   - Optimize FAISS index configuration
   - Add context-aware paper filtering
   - Improve relevance scoring

3. Response Formatting and Structure
   - Standardize paper listing format
   - Implement consistent numbering system
   - Add proper spacing and capitalization
   - Ensure complete paper information display

4. Content Processing Pipeline
   - Enhance content cleaning procedures
   - Implement standardized normalization
   - Add validation checks for paper metadata
   - Optimize processing performance

5. Model Integration and Configuration
   - Fine-tune Gemma model parameters
   - Optimize Gemini API integration
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add fallback mechanisms

6. Quality Assurance Features
   - Add response quality metrics
   - Implement automated testing
   - Add monitoring and logging
   - Create performance benchmarks

Technical Requirements:
- Python-based implementation
- FAISS for vector similarity search
- Gemini API integration
- Local Gemma model deployment
- Vector database for paper embeddings
- Proper API key management
- Efficient caching system

Success Metrics:
1. Reduction in duplicate recommendations
2. Improved response formatting consistency
3. Higher paper recommendation relevance
4. Reduced response latency
5. Better user satisfaction scores

Timeline:
- Phase 1: Core improvements (deduplication, matching)
- Phase 2: Response quality enhancements
- Phase 3: Performance optimization
- Phase 4: Testing and deployment
